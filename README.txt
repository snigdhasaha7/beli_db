The data has been generated through a Python library called faker
(https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/). We generated preliminary tables
to run queries.

To load and start up our program, please simply run `source makefile.sql;'. 

For running our Python programs, either use `python app-admin.py` or
`python app-client.py`, depending on the use case. Please note, if using the
client interface, you will either be prompted to log in or to create a new 
user.

When using the admin interface, the list of users will be dumped in a txt file,
keyed by user_id and valued by username.
