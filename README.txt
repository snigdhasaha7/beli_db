This is the final project for CS/IDS 121 - Databases. We emulate the popular food review app, Beli. 

The data has been generated through a Python library called faker
(https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/). We generated preliminary tables
to run queries.

To load and start up our program, please simply run `source makefile.sql;'. 

For running our Python programs, either use `python app-admin.py` or
`python app-client.py`, depending on the use case. Please note, if using the
client interface, you will either be prompted to log in or to create a new 
user.

Here's a test user to use for the client:
Username: laura_2784
Password: V7Usjj^n*D

A test restaurant to rank is: 
Restaurant Name: Chipotle
Restaurant Location: Seattle

When using admin, a test restaurant to add is: 
Restaurant Name: Panda Express
Restaurant Location: Los Angeles 
Cuisine: Chinese
Category: Restaurants 

This ^ will also update chains if that option is called, so its a good test.
